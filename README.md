# Drawn-Theme-Test
It makes things look pretty

The extension that I made for myself. Only take the .zip everything else is just so you know whats in there before you download it.

Know now that some things (mostly green buttons) look very ugly with this theme. So I guess what I mean is watch the continue button. Feel free to edit this if you know how and use this at your own will I don't care. I tried to make an extension where you could set your own settings easily but that didn't work out too well.
