# Drawn-Theme-Test
The extension that I made for myself.
Know now that some things (mostly green buttons) look very ugly with this theme. So I guess what I mean is watch the continue button. Feel free to edit this if you know how and use this at your own will I don't care. I tried to make an extension where you could set your own settings easily but that didn't work out too well.
